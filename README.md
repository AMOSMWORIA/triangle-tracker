## My-first-Web-Portfolio
This is  a web page that allows the user to input the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns whether these sides form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle or if the sides cannot make a triangle at all. 

## BDD
#The Program recognizes 3 values that are Equal;
Input Example :value(a) = 9 value(b) = 9 value(c) = 9
Output Example:This is an ** Equilateral Triangle

#The Program recognizes when only 2 values are Equal;
Input Example : value(a)=9 value(b)=8 value(c)=9
Output Example: This is an Isoscelese Triangle

#The Program recognizes when all values are unequal;
Input Example:value(a)=7 value(b)=8 value(c)=9
Output Example: This is a Scalene Triangle

## The Program recognizes when the three values don't form a triangle;
Input Example :value(a)=6 value(b)=7 value(c)=15
Output Example: This is not a Triangle.
